# Pumpcontrol
TM4C123GH6PM pump control written in C with IAR ARM

TEIV Project
Project idea 1.)
Construction of a small pump control with 4 float switch inputs
The float switch inputs are galvanically isolated from the power supply of the ÂµC by optocouplers. The float switches represent the water level a LED gives a feedback if the water level is reached.
Sensor inputs:
Float switch arrangement:

4 high water
3 water level pump-2 active
2 Water level pump-1 active
1 dry run protection

Methane measurement to avoid explosions. MQ7 Sensor EX range
Outputs:
BC847 NPN transistor switches print Relaie 
Pump 1 Pump 2
PIN
